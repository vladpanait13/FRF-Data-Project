# FRF-Data-Project

For the FRF Data Project, I will do a Player Scouting Scoring System, computing a score from multiple indicators to filter/identify suitable players for a profile. The covered position will be that of a Centre Back, assuming our Head Coach is looking for a new player to start in the aforementioned position.

Here is a short break-down of the Defending Roles, to have a better understanding of what are the responsibilities of each CB.

Wide Centre-Back 
Definition:

    The main job of this role is to stop the opposing attackers from playing and to clear the ball from danger when required. However, unlike standard central defenders - the Wide Centre-Back is encouraged to stay wide in position and support the midfield more like a full back.

Roles:

    Defend - The player is more like a traditional centre-back in a back five. They will provide support in wide areas at times, but from deep. Less likely to overlap or underlap and more likely to provide a diagonal backwards passing option.
    Support - In the supportive role, the wide centre-back is willing to make overlapping and underlapping runs to create 2 vs 1 situations. In this essence, they play more of a “fullback” role in supporting the midfield.
    Attack - With an attack duty, the player is willing to make regular overlapping and underlapping runs to create 2 vs 1 situations, and also has a higher tendency to dribble with the ball.

Central Defender
Definition:

    Main job is to clear the ball from danger when needed to. In certain tactics this includes being good on the feet and maintaining possession.

Roles:

    Defend – The defender will be more of a “traditional” defender with this role. They will be with their defensive partner(s) in working to break up attacks, preventing the ball from going into the box and marking opposition as a part of your tactic.
    Stopper – The stopper is the defender who will step up a bit more and close down players, marking earlier in the defensive plays.
    Cover – This role will make your defender play more as a sweeper, they will drop back a bit further then your defensive partner(s) and sweep up balls and mark overlapping players (has to be made specific with tactics).

Sweeper
Definition:

    The libero literally means “to sweep”. They will stay behind the defensive line, looking to sweep up through balls, pick up extra forward players and make goal saving plays. This role has seen goalkeepers take this role as they play out more from the box. One brilliant positive of this role is the fact that this player allows an extra individual to be further back for taking care of defensive errors and taking possession of bad or loose balls.

Roles:

    Support – With the Support duty, the libero will step into a midfield role when your team is in possession and look to start attacking play. Essentially a deep lying playmaker.
    Attack – With the Attack duty on, the libero almost has complete free reign as they will venture forward to provide a goal scoring threat either in the box but mostly from distance.

Ball Playing Defender
Definition:

    This is the more common role seen in today’s football with defenders having to play out of the back and be excellent in passing. They will still have the main duty of being a defender and stop opposition attacks, but they are encouraged to play long balls or start moving forward with splitting balls and passes. This is really key for counter attacks.

Roles:

    Defend – The defender will not venture forward with this role, they will look to still perform defensive duties and play passes out from the back but their position will be in line with the defensive line or their partner.
    Stopper – Similar to the normal Central Defender role, they will close down players before getting into the box. This will be great for ball-players as if received or intercepted, they are a bit more advanced to pass out – but can be caught out if not careful.
    Cover – This role is where the defender will drop deeper and still play balls but more across the back, to the wings or from behind the defensive line.

No-Nonsense Centre Back
Definition:

    The “old-school” role of a defender with only one thing in mind – clear it and stop attacks. The goal of the defender with this duty is to win the ball and get it cleared up the field and take no risks in doing so. Sometimes these clearances involve sending it to the stands rather than look for a pass, even if at moderate risk.

Roles:

    Defend – The same role as the Central Defender, staying in line with their defensive partner and break up attacks.
    Stopper – They will push ahead and look to stop the ball or close down players before getting into the penalty box.
    Cover – Will drop a touch deeper to sweep up any long balls.
