# FRF-Data-Project

For the FRF Data Project, I will do a Player Scouting Scoring System, computing a score from multiple indicators to filter/identify suitable players for a profile. 

The covered position will be that of a Centre Back, assuming our Head Coach is looking for a new player to start in the aforementioned position. I am creating a system where the best players of the previous season can be filtered, based on their roles and duties.


# üõ°Ô∏è Defending Roles Breakdown

A short breakdown of the **Defending Roles** to better understand the responsibilities of each Centre-Back (CB) type in modern football.


## üî≤ Wide Centre-Back (WCB)

**Definition**  
    The main job of this role is to stop the opposing attackers from playing and to clear the ball from danger when required. However, unlike standard central defenders - the Wide Centre-Back is encouraged to stay wide in position and support the midfield more like a full back.

**Roles:**

- **Defend:**  
  Functions more like a traditional CB in a back five. Supports wide areas from deep positions and acts as a diagonal passing option, rarely overlapping.

- **Support:**  
  Makes overlapping and underlapping runs to create 2v1 situations. Acts more like a fullback to support the midfield.

- **Attack:**  
  Frequently overlaps and underlaps, actively joins the attack, and dribbles forward when needed.


## üü¶ Central Defender (CD)

**Definition**  
    Main job is to clear the ball from danger when needed to. In certain tactics this includes being good on the feet and maintaining possession.

**Roles:**

- **Defend:**  
  Traditional defensive role. Works with defensive partners to break up attacks, block balls, and mark opponents.

- **Stopper:**  
  Steps up to close down attackers early and engage before they enter the box.

- **Cover:**  
  Sits slightly deeper, acting like a sweeper. Clears up long balls and tracks runners. Tactical specificity is key.


## üü® Sweeper / Libero

**Definition**  
    The libero literally means ‚Äúto sweep‚Äù. They will stay behind the defensive line, looking to sweep up through balls, pick up extra forward players and make goal saving plays. This role has seen goalkeepers take this role as they play out more from the box. One brilliant positive of this role is the fact that this player allows an extra individual to be further back for taking care of defensive errors and taking possession of bad or loose balls.

**Roles:**

- **Support:**  
  Steps into midfield in possession and starts attacking moves. Functions like a deep-lying playmaker.

- **Attack:**  
  Granted freedom to push forward, offering a goal-scoring threat‚Äîmostly from range.


## üü© Ball-Playing Defender (BPD)

**Definition**  
    This is the more common role seen in today‚Äôs football with defenders having to play out of the back and be excellent in passing. They will still have the main duty of being a defender and stop opposition attacks, but they are encouraged to play long balls or start moving forward with splitting balls and passes. This is really key for counter attacks.

**Roles:**

- **Defend:**  
  Stays in line with the defense, performs traditional duties, and distributes the ball safely from the back.

- **Stopper:**  
  Steps forward to intercept or press. Advantageous for quick passes post-interception but can be risky.

- **Cover:**  
  Drops deeper, distributing sideways or diagonally from the back, supporting build-up from behind the line.


## üü• No-Nonsense Centre-Back (NCB)

**Definition**  
    The ‚Äúold-school‚Äù role of a defender with only one thing in mind ‚Äì clear it and stop attacks. The goal of the defender with this duty is to win the ball and get it cleared up the field and take no risks in doing so. Sometimes these clearances involve sending it to the stands rather than look for a pass, even if at moderate risk.

**Roles:**

- **Defend:**  
  Stays aligned with the defense, focusing on breaking up plays and clearing the ball.

- **Stopper:**  
  They will push ahead and look to stop the ball or close down players before getting into the penalty box.

- **Cover:**  
  Drops deeper to clear long balls and deal with runners behind the line.
